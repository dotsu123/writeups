#Toke Relaunch - Web 
> We've relaunched our famous website, Toke! Hopefully no one will hack it again and take it down like the last time.

On this challenge, we get a website and the first thing to check is robots.txt which contains:
>User-agent: *
>Disallow: /secret_xhrznylhiubjcdfpzfvejlnth.html

Then we go to that url and we get the flag:

IceCTF{what_are_these_robots_doing_here}
